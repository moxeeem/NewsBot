## Dataset
The dataset used to build the models was created by parsing news articles from the website fontanka.ru. The news is divided into topics that make up the classes. The classes are absolutely balanced.

The dataset uses news posts mainly from 2023, but also contains records from 2018-2022. In total it contains 26719 records.

**Target Variable**
- `topic` (categorical, string) : the topic of the news post

## Exploratory Data Analysis
In this project, we analyze our data and perform EDA to understand its main characteristics before building our model. We found that articles are evenly distributed across topics, with most news from 2023. The publication dates show peaks in August and September, with fewer articles in winter. Weekdays have more news compared to weekends.

We also examined the average lengths of titles and articles. Keywords were also explored. Keywords are a key consideration, as articles from different topics share dominant keywords, affecting the model.

The number of views is important but varies with article age. We introduced the average growth rate of views but found it doesn't follow a lognormal distribution. The number of comments also doesn't have a lognormal distribution and resembles an exponential one.
